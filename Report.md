## Introduction

Some words on the backgorund of your projects.
Which plants did you select and why ?

The aim of this report is to study the metabolome of several Salvia strains cultivated in the botanical garden of the University of Fribourg. The ambition is to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree based on the metabolome’s analysis and compare it to databases and similar studies. Data collected will contribute to the molecular cartography of the botanical garden. This project is led by Dr. Emmanuel Defossez and Dr. Pierre-Marie Allard [^1]. 

The study of related plants’s metabolome approaches phylogeny from an innovative perspective. It opens up investigation tracks for understanding the diversity of species we encounter in nature. Mass spectrometry(MS) -based plant metabolomic should be as efficiant as sequencing. It's what we want to experiment with our porject. Firstly it’s important to think about which type of metabolite can help to solve our biological question.

Plants are sessile and cannot escape to their environment. They must adjust their metabolism to both abiotics and biotic stress. Metabolites produced may therefore be likely different in the same plant living in an inhospitable environment than in a hospitable environment. This hypothesis raises the impact of the choice of metabolites analysed. In our study we bypass this potential source of error. Salvia sampling was made in the same area of the botanical garden. It means that we assume that plants have been subjected to identical stress. Of course, this does not simplify the selection of metabolites potentially suitable to detect phylogenetic links between species. 

Interesting plant metabolites have already been measured by MS and listed[^2]. Based on the observations made the spatio-temporal distribution of metabolites in the plants could be pointed out. This underlines the importance of sampling points on the plant. For our experiment, we systematically sampled  leaves. It would also have been interesting to take the roots of each plant but for a concern of preservation of our study specimen we did not collect the roots. 

At this point the harvest strategy is defined and the wet lab part starts. The solvent used for the extraction is also a delicate concern because it can lead to a metabolit selection before MS-analysis. The extraction solution used in this study is MeOH/H2O/formic acid (80:20:0.1). Hydrophilic compounds were extracted with polar organic solvent such as methanol because of its affinity for water molecules that leads to a hydrophilic molecules rearrangement. A low concentration of acid such as formic acid helps the ionisation of molecules and it implies that analytes become more basic than solvent [^3].  As explained, the extraction step modifies our sample and proceeds to a metabolites sorting during extraction steps. So in this study the harvest and extraction steps were performed at the same time and  in the same way for all samples to reduce variability between samples. 

After extraction and before MS-analysis an additional step of separation is executed: a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Briefly explained, metabolites pass through a solid column driven by a mobile phase. This leads to an elution at different speeds based on their affinity properties with the solid column and the mobile phase. At the end of the column molecules come through with a specific retention time according to their electronic properties [^4]. 
The final step of the wet lab part strategy is the MS. This technique has opened up the perspectives of understanding the global molecular cell dynamics and is commonly used in proteomic and metabolomic research. These studies are closely related since many metabolite’s transformations are induced by enzymes which are proteins.

The machine is composed of three elements: an ion source, mass analyser and detector. The first element of the MS performs an electrospray ionisation. It means that the ionized analytes are sprayed through a needle with high electrical potential before entering in the analyser chamber. Time of flight analyzer (TOF) was used in this study. It correlate time of flight to mass. It determines the m/z ratio [^5].

The dry lab part corresponds to data analysed. … [^6] [^7]

Among the genus Salvia from the lamiaceae family, we collected 14 plants of 11 different species. They represent 3 clades subgenus (Glutinaria, Salvia and Sclarea) of the 11 commonly accepted. Heterosphae is not clearly defined as a clade but its heritage differs as a result of geographical events. A genomic study using next-generation sequencing on which we base our comparison, defined Heterosphae as a clade [^8]. To simplify and do easier comparisons we will use the same nomenclature.

*...add things*

On April 13, 2022 14 leaves of plants were collected in the botanical garden of Fribourg and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Then samples were dried for 24 hours and stored at -80°C. 
It was a sunny day (average temperature 15.8°C in Fribourg [^10]). Plants observations were loaded with their geo-localisation on the INaturalist website (DBGI project) [^11].

Material :
*-Smartphone (take picture and load them with the application INaturalist)
-Knife and tweezers (collect more or less one leave of each plants: ≥50g dry sample per strain)
-14x 15mL Eppendorf tubes
-Liquid nitrogen in expanded polystyrene box or in its suitable bucket
-Dryer (Manufacturer Zirbus technology)

### Sample preparation

- Describe your sample preparation

This step requires the following material and tasks. 

Material :
*-Tweezers
-Analytical weight-scale 
-15x 1.5mL Eppendorf tubes and 15x glass vials with their caps 
-Liquid nitrogen in its bucket 
-Iron beads (3x per samples)
-Mixer mill MM 400 (Manufacturer Retsch)
-Spinner for 1.5mL Eppendorf tube

Protocol :
*Weigh 50g  ± 0.5g in a 1.5mL Eppendorf tube (use gloves, glasses and lab coat)
Add 3 iron beads per tubes and add one tube with 3 beads (blank)
Disrupt cells (Program: 30Hz, 3min) at room temperature
Add 170µL of extraction solution MeOH/H2O/formic acid (80:20:0.1) in each sample tubes and blank
Spin tubes (this step is not required for the blank tube)
Prepare labels : DBGI-07-n°sample
Transfer 1mL supernatant in glass vial and screw caps
Store them at -80°C  

### LCMS Analysis

- Describe the LC conditions

On Wednesday 4 Mai, we load samples. We don’t wash the column between samples and don’t add blanks between them either. The first run is performed with the blank and samples are stored in a cold chamber at 10°C before loading. Then a mixture of all samples is made and injected as a wash to set basis conditions before the injection of samples. (Q-Exactive)
The column is heated in order to reduce the viscosity of the running phase. It reduced the pressure required to push samples and analysis time. One run is done in 8 min. The gradient increases until the 6th minute and then stays at a high level of hydrophobicity. It means at the beginning of the run it’s low hydrophobic and then it’s high hydrophobic.

### Data treatment

- Describe the software and parameters used.

Raw  data is on a switchdrive [^12]. raw data files extension is converted in .mzML by proteowizard software [^13] and then processed with MzMine 2.53 software [^14]. It allows us to filter pics and identify for example possible contaminants such as environmental pollution or plastic coming from lab furniture. Pics are centroiding and then isotopes are grouped. Then clean data is loaded on filezilla to have common access on the internet [^15]. From filezilla data is then loaded on GNPS (Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking) [^16]. We also used another software named cytoscape to visualise molecular networks.

The following setting were used:
Molecular Networking and Spectral Library Search
A molecular network was created with the Feature-Based Molecular Networking (FBMN) workflow (Nothias L-F, Petras D, Schmid R et al. Nature Methods 17, 905–908 (2020)) on GNPS (https://gnps.ucsd.edu, Wang M et al. Nat. Biotech. 2016). The mass spectrometry data were first processed with MZMINE2 (cite accordingly, see below in the Citations section) and the results were exported to GNPS for FBMN analysis. The precursor ion mass tolerance was set to 0.02 Da and the MS/MS fragment ion tolerance to 0.02 Da. A molecular network was then created where edges were filtered to have a cosine score above 0.7 and more than 6 matched peaks. Further, edges between two nodes were kept in the network if and only if each of the nodes appeared in each others respective top 10 most similar nodes. Finally, the maximum size of a molecular family was set to 100, and the lowest scoring edges were removed from molecular families until the molecular family size was below this threshold. The spectra in the network were then searched against GNPS spectral libraries (Cite Wang M, et al. Nature Biotech. 2016 and Horai, H. et al. J. Mass Spectrom. 45, 703-714 2010). The library spectra were filtered in the same manner as the input data. All matches kept between network spectra and library spectra were required to have a score above 0.7 and at least 6 matched peaks. The DEREPLICATOR was used to annotate MS/MS spectra (Mohimani, H. et al. Nat. Commun. 9, 4035 (2018)). The molecular networks were visualised using Cytoscape software (Shannon, P. et al. Genome Res. 13, 2498-2504 (2003)).
Data Deposition and Job Accessibility
The mass spectrometry data were deposited on public repository (provide the deposition accession number), such as MassIVE or MetaboLights. The molecular networking job can be publicly accessed at https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/status.jsp?task=d9eb8151a9f5459dad892bb449ccc95a (we recommend sharing this link in your manuscript).
