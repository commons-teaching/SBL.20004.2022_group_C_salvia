## Introduction

Some words on the backgorund of your projects.
Which plants did you select and why ?

The aim of this report is to study the metabolome of several Salvia strains cultivated in the botanical garden of the University of Fribourg. The ambition is to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree based on the metabolome’s analysis and compare it to databases and similar studies. Data collected will contribute to the molecular cartography of the botanical garden. This project is led by Dr. Emmanuel Defossez and Dr. Pierre-Marie Allard [^1]. 

The study of related plants’s metabolome approaches phylogeny from an innovative perspective. It opens up investigation tracks for understanding the diversity of species we encounter in nature. Mass spectrometry(MS) -based plant metabolomic should be as efficiant as sequencing. So it’s important to think about which type of metabolite can help to solve our biological question.

Plants are sessile and cannot escape to their environment. They must adjust their metabolism to both abiotics and biotic stress. Metabolites produced may therefore be likely different in the same plant living in an inhospitable environment than in a hospitable environment. This hypothesis raises the impact of the choice of metabolites analysed. In our study we bypass this potential source of error. Salvia sampling was made in the same area of the botanical garden. It means that we assume that plants have been subjected to identical stress. Of course, this does not simplify the selection of metabolites potentially suitable to detect phylogenetic links between species.
